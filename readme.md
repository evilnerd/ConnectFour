# Console Connect Four

This is a console-based ConnectFour game, written in Golang.

It's a tiny experiment to try out [BubbleTea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and 
[LipGloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss). Both are libraries that enable beautiful console-based 
applications in Go.
